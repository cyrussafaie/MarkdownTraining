This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


Markdown is technically a scripting language (really??)

*italics* and _italics_

**bold** and __bold__

superscript^2^

~~strikethrough~~

Place code inline with a single back ticks. The
first back tick must be followed by an R, like
a=2,abd b=3 then a+b is equal to `r a=2;b=3;a+b`.

Add chunk options within braces. For example,
`echo=FALSE` will prevent source code from being
displayed, if `eval=FALSE`, knitr will not run the code in the code chunk:

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
paste("Hello", "World!")
```

If `collapse=TRUE`, knitr will collapse all the source and output blocks created by the chunk into a single block.

```{r collapse=TRUE}
paste("Hello", "World!")
```

There are many other R code chunck options which may also be extermely helpful such as warnings. Google R Markdown Chunk option for more details 

Couple of more examples from the RMarkdown default file in R studio:

```{r cars}
str(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Through markdown there is a functionality to create presentation embedding R code and LaTeX.

Here is one example I created for a project
